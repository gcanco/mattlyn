<p id="bio">Mattlyn is a senior in Gender and Sexuality Studies at Northwestern University with minors in Latinx Studies and Film and Media Studies. In 2017, she was awarded the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship. Through Mellon Mays, she works on independent research under the guidance of Dr. Myrna García in Latinx Studies and Dr. Nick Davis in English. Her research focuses on queer world-making that occurs in trans*-Latinx American films. She has presented her work at several national and regional conferences, with the culmination of this work taking the form of her senior thesis. In addition to her own project, she is aiding Dr. Geraldo Cadava in the creation of the Congressional Hispanic Archive, which will consist of oral histories of past and current Latinx politicians. In her free time, Mattlyn has co-written a play that was performed at Northwestern and is a staff writer for the Queer Reader, Northwestern’s queer and feminist magazine.</p>
