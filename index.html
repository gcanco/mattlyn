<p>Mattlyn Cordova is an incoming PhD student in American Studies at Harvard University. She is a recent alumnus of Northwestern University, where she graduated with honors in Gender and Sexuality Studies, with minors in Film and Media Studies and Latinx Studies. At Northwestern, she received the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.northwestern.edu/president/special-projects/mellon-mays-undergraduate-fellowship/our-fellows/2019/mattlyn-cordova.html">Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship</a>, which funded her independent research conducted under the guidance of Dr. Myrna García in Latinx Studies and Dr. Nick Davis in English.</p>
<p>Broadly, she is interested in the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality within film and television. Her research as underaduate focused on queer world-making that occurs in American trans*-Latinx films. She has presented her work at several national and regional conferences, with the culmination of this work taking the form of her senior thesis, “Walking the Borderlands: A Framework of Trans* Latinx World-Making in Film.” Her thesis was awarded the Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs Prize in Gender and Sexuality Studies as well as the Latinx Studies Thesis Prize.</p>
<p>In addition to her own project, she aided Dr. Geraldo Cadava in the creation of the Congressional Hispanic Archive, which will consist of oral histories of past and current Latinx politicians. In her free time, Mattlyn co-wrote a play that was performed at Northwestern and wrote for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thequeerreader.com/home/2018/5/23/a-case-for-feminist-mentorship">Queer Reader</a>, Northwestern's queer and feminist magazine. She grew up in Wenatchee, Washington, affectionately known as “Apple Capital of the World.”</p>
